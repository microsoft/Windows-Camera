# WinRT sample applications for using the [Windows Media Capture APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Capture.MediaCapture)

	This folder contains a sample application that demonstrates the Windows Media Capture API GetDeviceProperty/SetDeviceProperty with KSPROPERTYSETID_ExtendedCameraControl in Windows 10. 
## About the sample
	The sample demonstrates the following:
		1. Class definition for correctly accessing/storing a KS Property Structure in WinRT
		2. Differences in using KS Properties with different payload sizes (in this case, KSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_VIDEOPROCSETTING vs KSCAMERA_EXTENDEDPROP_VALUE)
		3. How to enumerate a camera using SensorGroup
	

## Requirements
	
	This sample is built using Visual Studio 2017 and Windows SDK version 19551

## Using the samples

The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file containing the current version (using the following link or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page). You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples in Visual Studio 2017.

   [Download the samples ZIP](../../archive/master.zip)

   **Notes:** 
   * Before you unzip the archive, right-click it, select **Properties**, and then select **Unblock**.
   * Be sure to unzip the entire archive, and not just individual samples. The samples all depend on the SharedContent folder in the archive.   
   * In Visual Studio 2017, the platform target defaults to ARM, so be sure to change that to x64 or x86 if you want to test on a non-ARM device. 


**Reminder:** If you unzip individual samples, they will not build due to references to other portions of the ZIP file that were not unzipped. You must unzip the entire archive if you intend to build the samples.

For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, please refer to the guidance, tutorials, and reference topics provided in the Windows 10 documentation available in the [Windows Developer Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=532421). These samples are provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows.
